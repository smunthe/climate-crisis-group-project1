            <h2>Florida Yew</h2>
            <p>
                The Florida Yew is often found on privately owned land and in danger due to endanger species laws 
                don't apply to plants on private property. These are one of the rarest trees in the world and only found 
                on one side of the Apalachicola River in Florida. This plant contains a cancer-fighting compound known as Taxol, 
                which was proven useful in treating breast cancer, ovarian cancer, some kinds of leukemia and certain kidney diseases.

                Also Known as the "Tree of Life". This plant has medicinal propertys, used to help conditions ranging from artritis to coughs to syphilis. 
                Over harvesting and reducing native poulation due to deforestation has caused the Lignum vitae to be listed as 'Endangered' by IUCN 
                (The World Conservation Union).

            <h2>Bumble Bee</h2>
            <p> 
                Western Bumble Bees are major pollinators to many crops. Many crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and cranberries, require buzz pollination in order to grow. 
                Major threats to bumble bees include spread of pests, diseases, habitat destruction, predator population cycles, and climate change.

            <p>
                The first butterfly to be protected under the Endangered Species Act. It was listed as threatened on April 28, 1976. 
                The loss of habitiat and food plants was pushing the Schaus swallowtail towards the brink of extinction.

            <h2>Grizzly Bear</h2>
            <p>
                Grizzly bears have been protected under the Endangered Species Act since 1975, yet government wildlife agencies continue to push for their removal from the federal list despite clear evidence that the species benefits from these protections. 
                Grizzly bears still face threats from climate change, dwindling food resources, illegal poaching, and the negative impacts of roads fragmenting their habitat.

            <h2>Shark</h2>
            <p>
                Sharks are overfished due to high demand, mainly for fins, and poor fishery management, with species like spiny dogfish and porbeagle targeted for meat. 
                Many sharks are also caught unintentionally in fishing gear for other species and discarded, further contributing to their decline.

                Kiwi birds face major threats from habitat loss, invasive predators, and human activity, which have drastically reduced their populations. 
                Though the little spotted kiwi is classified as near threatened, all kiwi species face similar dangers that require urgent conservation efforts.

            <h2>White-Rumped Vulture</h2>
            <p>
                These vultures play a vital role as scavengers, cleaning up animal carcasses in their ecosystems. 
                Their decline is largely due to Diclofenac, a veterinary drug that causes fatal kidney failure when ingested through treated livestock carcasses.
